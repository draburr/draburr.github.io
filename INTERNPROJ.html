        <p style="text-indent: 30px;">In my 9th grade year I learned python with turtle, and in my 10th grade year I learned python. This year in 11th grade I learned HTML. Below are examples of some of the projects I have done.</p>
        
        <p>This python project is math practice where the user can pick a subject and keep answering the questions until they get one wrong. They will then have the choice to keep going or end the game:</p>

        <p>Another assignment I did in python was a math test. The user would be asked how many questions they wanted and if they want squared or cubed problems. The quiz restarts if the user does not score above an 80%:</p>

        <p>Another python project was to make a cash register and enter prices for how many items the user inputed and then give them the total including tax:</p>
